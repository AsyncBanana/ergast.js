# Contributing to Ergast.js

Thanks for your interest in contributing! First, make sure to read over the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/AsyncBanana/ergast.js/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Now, here is how you can contribute

> Please note that this is not a comprehensive list

## Implement optimizations or other improvements

If you see an area that could be optimized, shortened, or made more readable, feel free to submit a pull request for it! For these types of changes, try to split up the pull requests and avoid putting multiple unrelated changes together in one PR.

## Adding new features

The coverage of the API is not complete, and one major way to contribute is to add new features for getting the most out of the Ergast API. However, make sure you are following the same organization method and style as the other files.

## Creating documentation

This library is not fully documented, and if you enjoy writing, creating documentation is a great way to help!
